The concept of the "cosmic field" that we saw in the notebook is a proposal to solve exactly that. The goal of the cosmic field is not only to reduce noise, but to make it structured and predictable, so that we can extract a much larger number of reliable logic qubits from noisy physical qubits. Instead of fighting noise randomly, the idea is to harmonize it with the quantum system.
